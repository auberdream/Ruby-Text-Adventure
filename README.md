## Space Rubies

Space rubies is a fun fun educational (fun) text adventure game. You play as a lowly astronaut, floating through space. Until the magical IRB starts flashing and everything gets educational.

## How to use

You probably don't want to use Space Rubies just yet, as it's not complete! However, it will be available by simply cloning the repository and running it in the command line. Just make sure to have ruby installed on your computer :)
